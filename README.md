### Project structure

The project follows a modular structure with the following packages:
- `db`: Database-related components.
    - `repos`: Data repositories for database access.
    - `services`: Services for interacting with the database.

- `exceptions`: Custom exceptions generated by the application.

- `model`: Classes that model the Ludo game entities.

- `responses`: Classes to model the responses sent back from the API.

Key classes for the implementation of the game are:

- `LudoControllerV2`: The main controller class handling API endpoints.

- `BoardV2`: Class implementing the game logic, managing player actions, and the game state.

### API Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /ludo/rules`: Retrieve game rules.

- `POST /ludo/reset`: Reset the game.

- `POST /ludo/play/{username}`: Initialize a user for the game.

- `PUT /ludo/play/{username}/roll`: Roll the die for a player.

- `PUT /ludo/play/{username}/move/{pawn}`: Move a player's pawn.

- `GET /ludo/play/{username}/moves`: Get available moves for a player.

- `GET /ludo/status`: Get the current game status.

## Database Configuration

To configure the database, update the `application.properties` file with the corresponding properties.
After creating a database, run the script create_tables.sql to set up the required tables.
